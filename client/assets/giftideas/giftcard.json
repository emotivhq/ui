It is best to personally keep track of your balance, as most merchants will not be able to tell you.</li><br /><li>The card does not offer a line of credit like a credit card. &nbsp;For more information, you can visit visa.com at the following link: <a href='http://usa.visa.com/personal/personal-cards/gift-cards/index.jsp'>http://usa.visa.com/personal/personal-cards/gift-cards/index.jsp</a></li><br /><li>Once the gift is funded, we will order and fulfill the gift as requested, while also including the personal gift experience with your personal messages. &nbsp;Personalization is also included - we&rsquo;ll include your personal message(s) and card with images of everyone with this gift. &nbsp;</li><br /><li>No matter the occasion, Visa Gift Cards are smart, thoughtful, and well received. &nbsp;For other dollar amounts, please contact the Gift Concierge who can help you gift a custom dollar amount. &nbsp;Available in any amount between $100 and $500.</li><br /></ul>",
