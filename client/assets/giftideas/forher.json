Roomba&rsquo;s patented three-stage cleaning system removes dirt, dust and other debris, automatically adjusting to carpets, hardwood, tile and linoleum as it moves through your home. AeroVac technology maximizes air flow through the cleaning head, pulling hair and dust off the brushes and into the bin. A larger-than-ever bin means less frequent emptying, and longer-lasting brushes mean easier maintenance. Impressed yet? Wait &rsquo;til you hear this: Roomba&rsquo;s iAdapt Responsive Navigation Technology ensures that your robot cleans every corner of your room multiple times, even the hard-to-reach spots. Meanwhile, its Dirt Detect technology uses an acoustic sensor to identify the dirtiest areas, instructing the robot to spend more time there. Roomba can be scheduled to clean up to seven times per week, even when you&rsquo;re not home. A Virtual Wall confines the robot to specific rooms, and when it&rsquo;s finished cleaning, it automatically returns to its Home Base to recharge. &nbsp;Just press &ldquo;Clean&rdquo; and let Roomba take care of the rest!</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></div><br /><ul class=&quot;normal-list&quot;><br /><li><br /><p>Roomba 650 picks up an amazing amount of dirt, pet hair and other debris with its patented 3 stage cleaning system</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Dirt Detect technology employs an acoustic sensor to identify dirtier areas and spends more time cleaning them</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>iAdapt&trade; is an advanced system of software and sensors that ensures Roomba vacuums every section of your room and cleaning areas you cannot easily reach</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>The included Virtual Wall keeps Roomba cleaning where you need it and blocks off-limit areas</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>The robot can be scheduled to perform up to seven cleaning sessions per week, even when you are not home</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Features:&nbsp;Rechargable, Self Propelled, Easy Empty Dirt Container, Portable, Pet Hair Pick-Up, Cordless, Carry Handle</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Includes:&nbsp;Brush Cleaning Tool, Owner's Manual, Rechargeable Battery, Charger, Home Charging Base</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Recommended Surface Application:&nbsp;Hard Floor, Multi-Surface, Carpet, Hardwood</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Filter Type:&nbsp;Standard</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Number of Speeds:&nbsp;1</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Run Time:&nbsp;120 minutes</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Capacity (volume):&nbsp;49.0 Cu.
