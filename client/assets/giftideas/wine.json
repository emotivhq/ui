But, now that you've moved on from hearing about this legendary wine of France's Southern Rhone to drinking it, the 2009 Andre' Brunel is the perfect introduction to Chateauneuf-du-Pape. This Grenache-dominated blend (80% Grenache, 10% Syrah, 5% Mourv&egrave;dre and 5% Cinsault) from an excellent vintage, will bring out the Francophile in you.</p><br /><p>Not only is the wine impressive, rich and complex. The most distinct feature of the vineyards of the Chateauneuf-du-Pape, are the stones that blanket the region. Not only do the stones provide for a dramatic landscape, they also function to reflect heat during the day and store it at night. So every time you pull a cork on a bottle of this gorgeous Chateauneuf-du-Pape, raise your glass for a moment to the hard-working stones that helped make this wine possible.</p><br /><p>The wine classified as Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape Appellation d'origine contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e (AOC) is produced from grapes grown in the commune of Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape, which translates to &ldquo;New Castle of Pope&rdquo; as well as in portions of the four adjoining communes in the Vaucluse department. Unlike its northern Rh&ocirc;ne neighbors, Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape AOC permits many different varieties of grapes in their red wine, but the blend must be predominantly Grenache. Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape is traditionally cited as allowing thirteen grapevarieties to be used but, the 2009 version of the AOC rules in fact list eighteen varieties, since blanc (white), rose (pink) and noir (black) versions of some grapes are now explicitly listed as separate varieties.</p><br /><p>Red varieties allowed are Cinsaut, Counoise, Grenache noir, Mourv&egrave;dre, Muscardin, Piquepoul noir, Syrah, Terret noir, and Vaccar&egrave;se .White and pink varieties are Bourboulenc, Clairette blanche, Clairette rose, Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Picardan, Piquepoul blanc, Piquepoul gris, and Roussanne.</p><br /><p><strong>90 pts. Wine Spectator</strong><br />A silky, perfumy style, with mulled cherry and raspberry notes framed with singed mesquites notes. The long, supple finish lets a gentle black tea edge hang on. Shows more balance and finesse than power. Grenache, Syrah, Mourv&egrave;dre and Cinsault. Drink now through 2020.</p><br /><p>---</p><br /><p><strong>Included with this gift:</strong></p><br /><p><strong>Petite Decanter (828 ML)</strong></p><br /><p>An elegantly styled decanter designed for maximum aeration! Our petite bowl is designed for aerating red wines. Perfectly sized for one person enjoying a bottle (750 ml) of wine.</p><br /><p><strong>Two Piece Aerating Wine Funnel</strong></p><br /><p>Use this aerating wine funnel to smooth out the aroma, texture and flavor of younger wines, and to remove any bitter sediment common in older wines.

Farmed to Demeter Biodynamic discipline, from the original blocks dating back to 1990, it is a blend of Hedges Estate and Magdalena parcels, both under family control. This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon displays the true expression of Red Mountain terroir, and tells the &quot;story of the season' with each unique vintage. Demeter Biodynamic allows no herbicides, pesticides or synthetic fungicides to be used in farming the land, nor any commercial yeast to be present during fermentation. There is a commonality in authentic wines such as La Haute Cuv&eacute;e, they are intellectually provoking and wild, created under the laws of nature. The wine will cellar for many decades and should be decanted for several hours when drunk in the first 5 to 10 years after the vintage date.</p><br /><p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p><br /><p>Dark purple, almost black color. Aromas of mincemeat, allspice, mint, menthol and dried black berry with hints of black licorice and creamed corn. The entry is full bodied and somewhat astringent with flavors of dark fruits, menthol, mincemeat and toast. It finishes very long with a solid tannic backbone. This is a wild, complex, &ldquo;savage&rdquo; Cab that will definitely mellow on the palate (but not aromatically) over the next 10 to 20 years and seems to constantly change with every sniff and taste.</p><br /><p><strong>Cellaring:</strong></p><br /><p>This wine is currently not for the faint of heart. It is big, bold and tannic exploding with exotic aromas and flavors. Everything a Biodynamically made Cab should be. Taste it again in 5-10 year increments</p><br /><p><strong>Harvest Notes:</strong></p><br /><p>2012 was another excellent and more normal vintage in Washington State, a welcome change after the cooler and wetter 2010 and 2011 vintages. The &ldquo;fading&rdquo; La Ni&ntilde;a current brought warmer and more even spring and summer temperatures and an extended warm, dry autumn with perfect 80 to 85 Fahrenheit afternoon highs and 40 to 50 Fahrenheit lows without rain. The result was great set that yielded ripe, disease free fruit with good natural acidity. The resulting wines reflect the excellent qualities of the fruit and are a pleasure to drink. Probably one of the top 5 vintages Hedges Family Estate has been associated with in Washington State.</p><br /><p>AVA: Red Mountain<br />Blend: 100% Cabernet Sauvignon<br />Vineyard Percent: 80% Hedges 20% Magdalena<br />Winemaker: Sarah Hedges Goedhart<br />Bottle/Release Date: May 1, 2015<br />Titratable Acidity: 5.0 g/L<br />pH 3.84<br />Alcohol: 13.8% vol<br />Production: 1200 1.5 L bottles</p><br /><p>---</p><br /><p><strong>Included with this gift:</strong></p><br /><p><strong>Glass Decanter (828 ML)</strong></p><br /><p>An elegantly styled decanter designed for maximum aeration!

The sweetness of sparkling wine can range from very dry &quot;brut&quot; styles to sweeter &quot;doux&quot; varieties. Significant levels of carbon dioxide in it make it sparkle or fizz. The carbon dioxide may result from natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with the Traditional method, in a tank designed to withstand the pressures involved, in the Charmat process, or as a result of carbon dioxide injection.

These exotic aromatics are followed in the mouth by rich flavors of poached cherries, braised fig, fine grain tannins and balanced acidity. The finish is long and refined. This wine pairs well with beef, grilled pork, lamb, poultry, wild game, tuna, pasta and mild, firm cheeses. 100% Grenache</p><br /><p><strong>The 2012 Rotie Cellars Southern Blend</strong>, is also true to the Chateauneuf-du-Pape Appellation d'origine contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e (AOC) in grape varietal specifications and is a blend of 65% Grenache, 25 % Mourv&egrave;dre, and 10 % Syrah. The crisp, bright flavors of Grenache are complimented perfectly by the spiciness of the Mourvedre and the savory of the Syrah and Cinsault. This wine covers all spectrums of the palate and would do well paired with anything from cheeses to seafoods.</p><br /><p><strong>The 2010 Hollywood Hills Vineyard DIst83 Blend</strong> is comprised of 30% Grenache, 30% Mourv&egrave;dre, and 40% Syrah. Not quite as Grenache heavy, so the essence of Mourv&egrave;dre and Syrah, will be more apparent. Fresh berries and cotton candy dominate the nose, while the palate is loaded with licorice and black fruits. A talc element brings character to the wine which evolves into a long, pleasant finish.</p><br /><p><strong>Included with this gift:</strong></p><br /><p><strong>Petite Decanter (828 ML)</strong></p><br /><p>An elegantly styled decanter designed for maximum aeration! Our petite bowl is designed for aerating red wines. Perfectly sized for one person enjoying a bottle (750 ml) of wine.</p><br /><p><strong>Two Piece Aerating Wine Funnel</strong></p><br /><p>Use this aerating wine funnel to smooth out the aroma, texture and flavor of younger wines, and to remove any bitter sediment common in older wines. If taste and aroma are your priorities, taking the time to decant will pay off.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

         "productPrice":"150",
         "productDescription":"<p>Dense, complex and rich on palate with refreshing acidity and perfect balance. Rich in flavor with dominant notes of apricot, orange, pineapple and melon. Port: A distinctive berry taste adds just the appropriate amount of sweetness.</p><br /><p><strong>SAUTERNES AND PORT SEASONAL DESERT WINES ~ 6 BOTTLES TOTAL</strong> <br />There are many famous desert wines from each major wine region. Port from Spain and Sauternes from France are some of the most notable. Both have very distinct flavor profiles, coming from the types of grapes used, style of production and terroir of their very own distinct region. These wines are a great introduction to world class desert wines.</p><br /><p><strong>2005 Chateau Perle D'Arche Sauternes (375 ML) ~ 3 Bottles</strong><br />Many wine aficionados, who swear, they don&rsquo;t like sweet wine, will make this one exception. Sauternes, one of the world&rsquo;s most famous wines, happens to be a sweet wine from the sub-region, Graves, located on the left bank of the larger, famous region of Bordeaux.</p><br /><p><strong>Chateau d&rsquo;Yquem,</strong> the most highly regarded of all Sauternes, is a legendary elixir, which can age for many, many decades. Alas, it also has a legendary price tag, many hundreds of dollars... for a half-bottle. And, while some day, you may be lucky enough to taste Chateau d&rsquo;Yquem, whether through the grace of a generous friend, a lottery windfall, or divine providence, in the meantime you can enjoy a bottle of 2005 Chateau Perle d&rsquo;Arche Sauternes.</p><br /><p><strong>2005 Chateau Perle d&rsquo;Arche Sauternes</strong> is comprised of a blend of 90% Semillon with the remainder 10% Sauvignon Blanc. The grapes in this region have been infected with a fungus known as Noble Rot, or more specifically, Botrytris cinerea, brought on by the moist conditions from the Gironde River. This fungus, together with some desiccation the fungus causes, produces very low yields, one-fifth to one-sixth of that in other Bordeaux regions, hence the higher cost.</p><br /><p>The grapes are harvested much later than grapes for a dry wine, and then aged in small, oak barrels. All of this results in a wine that is very concentrated and intense in flavor. This golden, sweet wine, with high acidity, is the perfect end to a memorable meal. Though it pairs well will classic desserts like cr&egrave;me brulee, and is also a wonderful accompaniment to fruit-based desserts and sorbets, I think the best match is with savory food.</p><br /><p>Classic parings with Sauternes include: the best blue cheese you can find, p&acirc;t&eacute;, and foie gras. The strong, salty flavors of the cheese and p&acirc;t&eacute; are tamed by the rich, sweetness of the Chateau Perle d&rsquo;Arche Sauternes.</p><br /><p><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p><br /><p>Nose: Citrus notes of lemon, with a restrained nose of honey and pollen. Very rich with dried apricots, nectarines and peaches.</p><br /><p>Palate: It is dense, complex and rich on palate with refreshing acidity and perfect balance. Rich in flavor, with dominant notes of apricot, orange, pineapple and melon, and a hint of spice and caramel.</p><br /><p>The finish is quite a long and distinguished. It&rsquo;s extremely well-made and enjoyable for early drinking. .</p><br /><p>Ideal serving temperature: 10-13 degrees Celsius or 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><br /><p><strong>92 points Wine Spectator:</strong> Apple pie and lemon tart aromas, follow through to a full body, with medium sweetness and a lively, bright finish of citrusy acidity and spiciness. It's very young and powerful. Best after 2012.</p><br /><p><strong>91 points Wine Enthusiast:</strong> &quot;A well-balanced, concentrated wine, full of botrytis flavors: richness, poised honey and lemon. This is going to be an impressive wine for a second growth&mdash;in about 10 years&mdash;but already shows signs of greatness.&quot;</p><br /><p>---<br /><strong>1999 Alves De Sousa, Quinta Da Gaivosa LBV Port ~ 3 Bottles</strong><br />Domingos Alves de Sousa, a third generation winemaker, insisted upon only using grapes from his own estate to comprise his wines. This admirable legacy lives on to this day through his son, Tiago. Although not widely known here in the U.S., his winery has been repeatedly recognized for its excellence, and was most prominently awarded &ldquo;Producer of the Year&rdquo; in both 1999 and 2006 by Revista de Vinhos, Portugal&rsquo;s premier wine magazine.</p><br /><p>Fittingly, Terroir360 proudly offers his 1999 Quinta da Gaivosa Late Bottled Vintage Port. Unfiltered and stored in oak for five years, this Port retained all its geographic originality. You&rsquo;ll immediately notice its deep, rich color, and the hints of minerality add complexity to the earthy nose you&rsquo;d expect from its origin.</p><br /><p>A distinctive berry taste adds just the appropriate amount of sweetness that Port enthusiasts will appreciate and those with a less-trained palate will thoroughly enjoy. While this Port could be aged for up to another five years, it is highly unlikely, because it&rsquo;s the perfect companion to rich desserts, roasted nuts, or strong, pungent cheeses like blue, not unlike a Sauternes. Or enjoy it any time your sweet tooth beckons.</p><br /><p>Best of all, Ports hold well even after they&rsquo;re opened, especially if lightly chilled. Cheers! We recommend serving this wine at 15℃ (59℉).</p>",

It may be the oldest known type of wine. The pink color can range from a pale &quot;onion&quot;-skin orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the grape varieties used and winemaking techniques. There are three major ways to produce ros&eacute; wine: skin contact, saign&eacute;e and blending. Each Summer Sippers Case will include 3 bottles of Rose'</p><br /><p><strong>Sparkling</strong></p><br /><p>The classic example of a sparkling wine is Champagne, produced exclusivly in the Champagne region of France. Sparkling wine is usually white or ros&eacute; though there are many examples of red sparkling wines. The sweetness of sparkling wine can range from very dry &quot;brut&quot; styles to sweeter &quot;doux&quot; varieties. Significant levels of carbon dioxide in it make it sparkle or fizz. The carbon dioxide may result from natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with the Traditional method, in a tank designed to withstand the pressures involved, in the Charmat process, or as a result of carbon dioxide injection. Easch Summer Sippers Case will include 3 bottles of sparkling wine.</p><br /><p><strong>Sip and celebrate the magic in each bottle. </strong></p>",
