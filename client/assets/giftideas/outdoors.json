On the water the Bay glides like a dream. It's stable enough for beginners, while the length and contouring make it fast and sporty for expert kayakers. There's plenty of room to stash gear (or a picnic) for day trips and short camping excursions. Best of all, transforming it from box to boat takes just a few minutes.</p><br /><p>The Oru Kayak magically folds out of a compact box. You can pack it in a trunk, check it on a plane, or hike it in to remote waters. The Oru Kayak skin, a double-layered polypropylene formulated to our specifications, is manufacturer-rated for 20,000 fold cycles. It doesn't take a calculator to know that's a lot of days out on the water. The material is tough, resilient, and abrasion-resistant. The two layers offer extra protection and make Oru Kayaks naturally buoyant. All plastics used in fittings and connections are durable, marine-grade, and UV rated for long life. All metal fasteners are marine-rated stainless steel. Oru Kayaks are extremely rigid and sturdy. The patented fold pattern allows the skin to act as a monolithic structural unit, without the need for an internal frame. The skin is folded from a single, seamless sheet. The only seam is on top of the boat, above the waterline- and it closes tight with a waterproof seal. A rigid floorboard reinforces the cockpit (and doubles as the lid of the box). A pair of bulkheads provide extra rigidity. Simple straps and buckles hold everything together. Oru Kayaks are fully recyclable, and our manufacturing process uses 70% less petroleum than a standard kayak. Another way to save fossil fuels? We highly recommend kayak commuting. Oru Kayaks are designed and made right here in California. We're proud to be part of a new wave of American manufacturing-focused on quality, flexibility and continuous innovation. We believe in American workers, American suppliers, and American quality.</p><br /><h2>FEATURES</h2><br /><p>-Comfortable foam seat and fully-adjustable backrest</p><br /><p>-Easy-to-close watertight seams</p><br /><p>-2 rubber deck straps for extra gear</p><br /><p>-Easy-to-adjust footrest</p><br /><p>-Reinforced cockpit for easy entry</p><br /><p>-Pair of bulkheads for extra rigidity</p><br /><p>-Simple and intuitive strap and buckle closure system</p><br /><p>-Fits standard spray skirts (size medium)</p><br /><h2>SPECIFICATIONS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>LENGTH: 12' [3.7 M]</li><br /><li>WIDTH: 25&quot; [63 CM]</li><br /><li>WEIGHT: 26 LBS [12 KG]</li><br /><li>WEIGHT CAPACITY: 260-300LBS</li><br /><li>COCKPIT: 16&quot;X30&quot; [41X76 CM]</li><br /><li>BOX LENGTH: 32&quot; [81 CM]</li><br /><li>BOX WIDTH: 13&quot; [33 CM]</li><br /><li>BOX HEIGHT: 28&quot; [71 CM]</li><br /><li>US PATENT NO. 8316788</li><br /></ul>",
