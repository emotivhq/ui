         "productDescription":"<p>This set of fine champagne is perfect for celebrating milestones. A great way&nbsp;to use these three bottles is around deployment times. Pop open the first bottle during a special farewell dinner. The second bottle can be enjoyed by the spouse to celebrate the deployment's mid-way point. Leave the third bottle in a special place as a reminder of the good times to come, and open it once the family is reunited. If they're the sentimental type, preserving the corks in a special box or jar can be a meaningful keepsake and symbol of the strength and love it takes to make it through deployments.</p><br /><p>Details about the Champagne:&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Alexandre Lenique&nbsp;<em>Cuv&eacute;e Excellence Pur Noir</em></strong></p><br /><p>This cuv&eacute;e is 100% Pinot Noir, but completely star bright in color. It holds a bead of extremely fine and abundant bubbles, while delivering aromas of raspberry, red apple, a spicy character, and apple skin. It has an incredible finish that is lengthy, yet very clean. As it settles in the glass it smooths out and finishes more full-bodied. This is an excellent cuv&eacute;e with a long future ahead.</p><br /><p><strong>Gimonnet-Oger&nbsp;<em>Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru</em></strong></p><br /><p>This 100% Chardonnay cuv&eacute;e is based on the excellent 2005 vintage-- meaning this wine has been aged for 7 years! The palate is rich and expressive with the gorgeous chardonnay showing off for your senses.</p><br /><p><strong>Didier-Ducos Fils&nbsp;<em>Absolu Meunier</em></strong></p><br /><p>This 100% Pinot Meunier comes from only the oldest Ducos family vines. The palate is bold, and almost thick with fresh cream and hints of spice. This is a pure example of the outstanding character inherit in the normally obscure Pinot Meunier grape.</p>",
