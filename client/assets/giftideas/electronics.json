Now you can run a host of apps right alongside your game without any loss of performance.</p><br /><p><strong>Peak Performance</strong></p><br /><p>The Xbox One balances both power and performance. In addition to Xbox One's architecture, the combination of its CPU, GPU, and ESRAM provides both power and speed in harmony. So the Xbox One uses its power more effectively.</p><br /><p><strong>The Xbox One Controller</strong></p><br /><p>The Xbox One controller has over 40 technology innovations over its predecessor, the Xbox 360 controller. With Impulse Triggers, you'll experience precise fingertip feed for more realistic encounters. Kinect (sold separately) will auto-pair your controller instantly, even when you hand it to a friend during a game. Microsoft also streamlined the thumbsticks and contours as well as redesigned the infamous D-pad for improved precision and comfort in your hands.</p><br /><p><strong>High Resolution Graphics</strong></p><br /><p>Immerse yourself in cinematic worlds that look like real life, with characters that feel more human. Advanced AI technology and the processing power of Xbox One make game worlds come alive. And thanks to the power of the cloud, what you do in a game can stay that way persistently. Xbox One's unique architecture allows creators to build realistic, cinematic experiences of the highest fidelity possible.</p><br /><p><strong>Always On</strong></p><br /><p>The Xbox One was designed for today's fast-paced lifestyle.

And when you need to pause, your games are suspended right where you left off, so you can resume instantly.</p><br /><p><strong>Cross Platform</strong></p><br /><p>Get more from games and entertainment with unique cross-screen experiences.

Server based multiplayer experiences come to life with cloud-powered artificial intelligence creating epic experiences each time you play. And because every game is hosted by servers, host advantage, and player drops and ping times should be much improved.</p><br /><p><strong>Living Games</strong></p><br /><p>Just because you're not playing doesn't mean your games have to stop.

The C100 has been optimized for run-and-gun and one-man-band style shooting, a specialty of event videographers, documentarians and independent filmmakers. This camera is about 15% smaller than the C300, and yet its 1080p image will hold-up nicely beside that of the more expensive camera. The C100 even has a few features not found in the C300, like One Shot AF, Push Auto Iris, a built-in microphone, and uncompressed HDMI out with superimposed timecode and 2:3 pull down marker.</p><br /><div class=&quot;sectionHeaders js-hiddenFeatures&quot; data-selenium=&quot;sectionHeaders&quot;><br /><h3 class=&quot;featureHeader c27 fs24&quot;>NEW FEATURES</h3><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Dual Pixel CMOS AF Technology</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>This is an optional upgrade feature that provides enhanced autofocusing, which prevents motion artifacts during rapid talent and pan moves. This features requires your C100 to be sent to an accredited Canon service, where an upgrade will be installed at a cost of $500. <br /><br />This upgrade provides an Autofocus mode to help ensure sharp focus and smooth focus transitions. It provides a new Continuous AF (Autofocus) function for all autofocus Lenses, using Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology. A new AF Lock setting also lets you change the image framing while holding the desired focus. This feature is ideal for users who regularly shoot with smaller crews, who shoot moving subjects, or who want smoother, more natural-looking autofocus. <br /><br />Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology features a CMOS sensor that consists of an array of pixels that each feature two separate photodiodes. By continuously comparing their outputs during AF mode, phase-difference autofocus helps ensure non-blurred images and smooth focus transitions even when the talent and/or camera are moving. The new feature places a high priority on maintaining sharp focus while providing a natural, smooth autofocus movement with select Canon EF lenses &mdash; including newer-generation STM lenses &mdash; which offer even smoother and quieter operation. <br /><br />This upgrade will have firmware version 2.0.3.1.00, which also includes the Continuous Recording enhancement available with firmware version 1.0.3.1.00.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Continuous Recording Firmware Update</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Firmware update version 1.0.3.1.00, available free on Canon's EOS website, provides a continuous, nonstop recording function and the ability to create In and Out points in the footage every time the START/STOP button is pressed. At this time, the continuous recording function is compatible with Grass Valley's EDIUS Pro 7 software.</dd><br /></dl><br /><h3 class=&quot;featureHeader c27 fs24&quot;>ALL FEATURES</h3><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Super 35mm 8.3MP CMOS Sensor</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The C100's Super 35mm-sized sensor provides an angle-of-view and depth of field that equivalent to that of traditional Super 35mm film. With a native resolution of 8.3MP and a wider pixel pitch than conventional professional camcorders, the C100's sensor offers enhanced sensitivity and reduced noise in low light environments.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>EF Lens Mount with EF Contacts</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The C100 is fully compatible with Canon's renowned EF mount lenses. Even specialty lenses, such as Canon's 24mm f/3.5L II tilt shift lens or the 8-15mm f/4L Ultra-Wide Zoom fisheye lens, are available on the C100. When shooting with EF lenses, C100 features peripheral illumination correction, which automatically compensates for light fall-off in the corners of the image. Furthermore, continuous AF will be available via a firmware update for compatibility with Canon EF Lenses with STM focusing.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>HDMI Outputs an Uncompressed Signal</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The C100 outputs an uncompressed signal via HDMI. This signal superimposes timecode and the 2:3 pulldown marker, which means an external recorder and converter can process the HDMI output as an SDI signal. External recorders provide an instant back-up and help to streamline post-production workflows.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>ISO 320 to 80,000</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>A maximum ISO of 80,000 allows the C100 to record in low light environments. This is ideal for working with available light. Although higher ISOs always translate into a noisier image, the C100 utilizes the same signal processing as 3-chip RGB systems, which produces a superior image quality.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Dual SDHC/SDXC Card Slots</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Secure Digital memory cards offer professional grade read/write speeds and reliability at ever more affordable prices. Dual SDHC/SDXC memory card slots allow the C100 to record simultaneously to two memory cards, creating an instant back-up. What's more, C100 can record HD footage to Slot A while simultaneously recording down-converted SD footage to Slot B.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Wide DR and Canon Log Gamma</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Canon Log records an image with subdued contrast and sharpness, which preserves a high dynamic range and presupposes color grading in post production. Wide DR is a new gamma setting based on Rec. 709, which offers a wide dynamic range and smooth gradations in highlights and shadow, without requiring processing in post-production.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Reduced Rolling Shutter Skews</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Traditional CMOS sensors scan one line at a time and sometimes produce a rolling shutter skew when shooting fast moving objects or executing a quick pan. The C100's CMOS sensor features the same signal processing as 3-chip RGB systems, which reduces the angle of distortion compared to cameras with regular CMOS sensors of the same size.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Built-in ND Filters with Manual Operation</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>In excessively bright environments neutral density filters are often required to avoid over exposure, without compromising desirable shutter and aperture settings. The C100 features built-in ND filters in three densities, which make for four ND configurations (OFF, 2 stops, 4 stops, 6 stops). The built-in ND filters are deployed via a manual dial.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Two XLR Audio Connectors</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The C100 includes a top mounted handle unit, which features two XLR connectors and a microphone shock mount. XLR connections offer a high quality audio input for professional grade microphones and facilitate 2 channel 48kHz linear PCM (24Mbps) audio recordings.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>One Shot AF and Push Auto Iris</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>One-Shot AF executes focus adjustments with a dedicated button, and the Push Auto Iris button automatically adjusts the aperture of the lens to quickly and easily maintain proper exposure. Both of these functions can be accessed even when operating in manual mode.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Full Manual Control and Focusing Aids</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The EOS C100 offers complete manual control of each aspect of the recording process. Create and recall custom picture settings, camera functions, and display options. The camera also features several powerful and intuitive focusing aids in both the EVF and LCD monitor that make it easy to confirm critical focus distance; Peaking Modes and Magnify Focus Modes are available while in standby or while recording. Additionally, the LCD features Edge Monitor Display; green waveforms display the overall focus of the scene and red waveforms provide focus feedback of the three focus check boxes visible on the LCD monitor.</dd><br /></dl><br /></div>",

Thunderbolt is 20 times faster than USB 2.0 and up to 12 times faster that FireWire 800, poising this monitor in a position to change the way you work, play, and more! The 6 ports on the monitor include, of course, the Thunderbolt port, 3 powered USB 2.0 ports, a FireWire 800 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a Kensington security slot. That's a lot of flexibility when it comes to connecting other devices to the monitor.</p><br /><p>Speaking of other devices, the Thunderbolt Display turns your MacBook into one stunning desktop, but it can also add oomph to your iMac or Mac mini configuration. The glossy 27&quot; widescreen display has an incredible 2560 x 1440 resolution that makes everything you view on it come alive and the built-in speaker system and subwoofer provides full-range audio... which makes the monitor especially nice when using the FaceTime HD camera to chat with family and friends on other Macs. To connect, the monitor simply uses one-cable for Thunderbolt enabled Macs, making it a plug-and-play hub for your entire digital life. Additionally, the monitor comes with the MagSafe connector for powering the MacBook Pro or MacBook Air.</p><br /><div class=&quot;sectionHeaders js-hiddenFeatures&quot; data-selenium=&quot;sectionHeaders&quot;><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Thunderbolt Technology. Built Right In.</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Thunderbolt I/O technology lets you move data between your devices and your computer with unprecedented speed. With two channels of 10-Gbps throughput in both directions, it's up to 20 times faster than USB 2.0 and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800. And it allows you to connect as many as six devices through a single, compact port. Now, for the first time, all that power and flexibility is available through a port built right into your display. Which makes the Apple Thunderbolt Display so much more than just a pretty screen.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>The Ultimate Docking Station</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>With built-in Thunderbolt and MagSafe connections, the Apple Thunderbolt Display transforms any new Mac notebook into a complete desktop workstation<br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>One-cable convenience. Thunderbolt versatility.</strong><br />With its 27 inch LED-backlit screen, the new Thunderbolt Display delivers a brilliant viewing experience. But connect it to any Thunderbolt-enabled Mac, and it becomes a plug-and-play hub for everything you do. You get 27 inches of high-resolution screen space, high-quality audio, a FaceTime HD camera, and support for FireWire 800 and Gigabit Ethernet. All through a single connection</p><br /><p><strong>MagSafe connector.</strong><br />The Thunderbolt Display includes a MagSafe connector that powers and charges your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air. The connector sits on your desk, ready and waiting. No need to unwind the cord to the power adapter that came with your notebook. Leave it exactly where it is, in your bag</p><br /><p><strong>Do more with MacBook Air.</strong><br />Connect MacBook Air to the Thunderbolt Display and you can do even more with a computer that already does a lot. Like adding FireWire peripherals, connecting to Ethernet networks at gigabit speeds, and making large-as-life, HD video calls to other Mac users with the built-in FaceTime HD camera</p><br /><p><strong>Expand the capabilities of your MacBook Pro.</strong><br />Connect two Thunderbolt Displays to a 15- or 17-inch MacBook Pro or to an iMac and put an extra 7 million pixels to work. To make a desktop workstation out of your MacBook Pro, just daisy-chain additional Thunderbolt devices, including high-performance storage and video and audio capture devices, through the display</p><br /></dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>See the Bigger Picture</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>A 27 inch widescreen display with LED backlight technology.

This huge 27 inch glossy widescreen display features a cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio and an astonishing 2560-by-1440 resolution. That gives you more room to work with apps on your MacBook Air. More pixels for your MacBook Pro. And a worthy desktop companion to your iMac or Mac mini</p><br /><p><strong>LED backlighting. Bright on.</strong><br />Full brightness with no waiting. That's the big advantage of LED backlight technology. Unlike most displays that take time to warm up before they reach maximum brightness, an LED-backlit display is instantly on and uniformly bright. LED backlighting also gives you greater control over screen brightness. So you can tune the Thunderbolt Display to suit the ambient light in even the dimmest room</p><br /><p><strong>Crystal clear from every angle.</strong><br />The Thunderbolt Display looks great from any seat in the house, thanks to a premium display technology called in-plane switching (IPS). IPS delivers a bright picture with excellent color consistency, even if you're viewing the display from the side</p><br /><p><strong>Built-in Face Time HD camera and microphone.</strong><br />With the built-in FaceTime HD camera and microphone, you can connect your Mac desktop or notebook - open or closed - and make HD video calls or take a few snapshots using Photo Booth</p><br /><p><strong>Ambient light sensor.</strong><br />The ambient light sensor intelligently adjusts the brightness of the Thunderbolt Display to your room environment. This gives you the perfect brightness for any situation while using the least amount of energy necessary</p><br /><p><strong>Big, beautiful sound.</strong><br />The Thunderbolt Display gives you more than video. It gives you audio, too. The built-in speaker system includes an integrated subwoofer that delivers immersive, full-range sound for music, movies, and games</p><br /><p><strong>Smooth-motion hinge.</strong><br />Tilt the Thunderbolt Display to get the viewing angle that's best for you.

And flash storage is extremely energy efficient, which means your MacBook Pro also has the ability to stay in standby mode for up to a month without having to be plugged in.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Long-Lasting Battery</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The built-in lithium polymer battery provides up to 8 hours on a single charge (battery life may vary upon use) and gives you up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles as well as up to 30 days of instant-on standby time. Which means you can put your MacBook Pro to sleep, and it'll come back on instantly - after a day, a week, or even a month. With Power Nap, your MacBook Pro can continue to receive email and calendar invitations while it's asleep. And when it's connected to a power source, it can download software updates and make backups with Time Machine. So the next time you open your notebook, your MacBook Pro is updated and ready to go.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Thunderbolt 2</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The new MacBook Pro features the next-gen Thunderbolt 2. It delivers twice the throughput, providing up to 20 Gbps of bandwidth to each external device. So you're more than ready for the next generation of high-performance peripherals and displays. You can connect massive amounts of storage and add a PCI expansion chassis. And since each Thunderbolt 2 port allows you to daisy-chain up to six peripherals, you can go all out by plugging in up to 12 external devices via Thunderbolt alone.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>HDMI, USB 3.0, SDXC</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The MacBook Pro with Retina Display also has dual USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port and an SDXC card slot, so you can build an entire professional studio with the MacBook Pro as its centerpiece.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>802.11ac Wi-Fi</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>With an emphasis on mobile, the MacBook Pro with Retina Display is equipped with 802.11ac Wiâ€‘Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology. With AirPlay and Apple TV, you can wirelessly play video, show off photos, and enjoy music from your MacBook Pro on your widescreen TV. And when your MacBook Pro connects to an 802.11ac Wi-Fi base station, such as AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule, your wireless performance is up to three times faster.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Audio and Visual</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>For something so thin and light, the built-in speakers have a surprisingly wide dynamic range, an optimal balance and a crisp, expressive quality. Dual built-in microphones are great for when you want to be heard. If you're making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use Dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice instead of the noise around you.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Multi-Touch Trackpad and Backlit Keyboard</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>In Mac OS X, Multi-Touch is an essential part of how you interact with your Mac. Using realistic, intuitive gestures, you can switch between apps, navigate your content and get the most out of your desktop space. The MacBook Pro features a Multi-Touch trackpad with a large, all-glass button surface. So you can tap, pinch, swipe and click away comfortably. Thin and light, this notebook is designed to go anywhere, including places with less-than-stellar lighting. A built-in sensor detects changes in ambient light and adjusts the keyboard brightness automatically.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>iCloud</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>iCloud stores your content and lets you access your music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more from which ever device you're on. So you'll be able to access your photos, reminders, notes, music and videos from your iOS devices right on this MacBook Pro.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Retina-Ready Software</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Apple has updated their native apps to take advantage of the beautiful Retina display on this MacBook Pro. Mac OS X apps such as Safari, Mail, iCal, Address Book and more as well as iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes, Aperture and Final Cut Pro have already been optimized.</dd><br /></dl><br /><h3 class=&quot;featureHeader c27 fs24&quot;>Design</h3><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Incredibly Powerful</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>It may be thin and light, but this MacBook Pro is also incredibly powerful. To achieve all that in a single design required relentless focus and a willingness to make bold decisions. Bulky legacy technologies like the spinning hard drive and optical disc drive were left behind in favor of higher-performance technologies - all-flash storage, for example. It's much faster and far more reliable than a traditional hard drive. And it takes up 90 percent less space.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>A Display of Excellence</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The Retina display is a breakthrough - any way you look at it. Apple pushed the limits of technology to create a pixel density so high, you can see everything you're doing with perfect clarity and make edits with pinpoint accuracy. Not only is it the highest-resolution display ever on a notebook, it has a more integrated design that achieves a level of fit and finish never before possible. This Retina display doesn't sit behind a layer of glass, it is the glass. Which means you get all the benefits of a state-of-the-art display - vibrant colors, high contrast, and wide viewing angles - with very little glare. So there's more to see, and even less to distract you from your work.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Precisely Engineered</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>This MacBook Pro features high-efficiency fans. The asymmetrically spaced impeller blades with back and side airflow vents work together to move the maximum amount of air while reducing tonal impact. The custom, built-in stereo speakers provide high-fidelity sound and a wide dynamic range and better bass response. The dual microphones are precisely oriented under the speaker grille and use an adaptive beam-forming algorithm to reduce background noise and optimize performance.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Ultrathin and Ultraportable</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>This MacBook Pro is ultrathin and ultraportable, resembling more a MacBook Air than a MacBook Pro. It is 0.75&quot; thin and weighs 4.46 pounds, so this MacBook Pro embodies the performance of a MacBook Pro, but has the body of a MacBook Air.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Electrical and Operating Requirements</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>This MacBook Pro supports 100-240V AC with 50/60Hz frequency. It can operate at a temperature from 50 to 95&deg;F (10 to 35&deg;C) and an altitude of 10,000 feet. It can be stored at a temperature from -13 to 113&deg;F (-24 to 45&deg;C) and an altitude of 15,000 feet. It can also stand a relative humidity range of 0 to 90% (noncondensing).</dd><br /></dl><br /><h3 class=&quot;featureHeader c27 fs24&quot;>Performance</h3><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Photography</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>At 5.1 million pixels, the Retina display is the perfect place to view and edit your high-resolution photos. Dot for dot, more of your image can fit on the screen - which makes editing photos far more precise. The Retina display is so sharp, you can tell which photos are in focus just by looking at the thumbnails. With two ultrafast Thunderbolt ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an SDXC card slot, you can build a photo studio around this MacBook Pro. Or take it with you and import thousands of RAW images on location - up to five times faster than on a standard MacBook Pro. Once your photos are on your computer, editing in Aperture is faster and more responsive than on any other MacBook ever built. And high-speed flash storage lets you quickly browse large image libraries from internal storage. So you have instant access to any photo in your library.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Video Editing</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The processor, graphics, and memory inside the MacBook Pro are built around an all-flash architecture - giving you unprecedented mobile video editing capabilities. Super-responsive flash storage delivers up to nine streams of 1080p ProRes (HQ) content for multicam editing in Final Cut Pro X, while the state-of-the-art processor decodes multiple streams of video, and a powerful GPU renders millions of pixels onto the screen. With flash storage that offers up to four times the performance of a traditional hard drive, you can even edit four streams of uncompressed 8-bit 1080p HD video, right from your internal storage. Having four times the pixels of a traditional display changes how you edit video on a notebook. Especially in Final Cut Pro X. For the first time on a portable computer, you can view your video in pixel-accurate 1080p HD and see your editing workspace onscreen at the same time. And video is so sharp, so clear, and so lifelike, your shots may look even better than you remember.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Design and Layout</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>With 2880 by 1800 pixels, the resolution of the Retina display is so high, it rivals the printed page. Combined with reduced glare, higher contrast, and a 178-degree viewing angle, this Retina display is the ideal place to see your work. High-performance graphics and processors let you render images and apply filters with incredible speed. And thanks to flash storage and superfast 1600MHz memory, you can access and edit large-format files much faster than on a traditional notebook.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Science and Engineering</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The latest quad-core processors and 1600MHz memory provide an enormous amount of computational power. And the latest GPU technology and the high-resolution Retina display allow you to visualize your data like never before. From 3D molecular modeling and DNA imaging to architectural renderings and structural analysis, this MacBook Pro will have you working anywhere.</dd><br /></dl><br /><h3 class=&quot;featureHeader c27 fs24&quot;>Mac OS X</h3><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Hardware and Software</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Since the software on every Mac is created by the same company that makes the Mac, you get a fully integrated system in which everything works together perfectly. OS X works with the processor in your Mac to deliver the best possible performance. The Multi-Touch trackpad on every Mac notebook gives you more than enough space to pinch, swipe, and tap your way around most of the apps on your system. OS X gives you long battery life by dimming the screen in low-light conditions and even regulating processor activity between keystrokes.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Interact with Your Computer in a Whole New Way</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Tap, scroll, pinch, and swipe using Multi-Touch gestures, directly controlling what's on your screen in a more fluid, natural, and intuitive way. When you scroll down on your trackpad or Magic Mouse, your document scrolls down. When you scroll up, your web page scrolls up. When you swipe left, your photos move left. And there are many more gestures that make all you do on your Mac the best experience you can have on a computer.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Easy to Use</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>From the desktop you see when you start up your Mac to the applications you use every day, everything is designed to be simple and intuitive. It works seamlessly with iCloud to keep your music, photos, calendars, and more up to date across all your devices.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Find, Organize and Share Files Fast</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>The Finder gives you easy access to all the files on your system. It lets you find, organize and access practically everything on your Mac - including applications, files, folders, discs, and shared computers on your network. You can sort files by kind, application, date modified, date added, or size. But with so many files on your computer, finding a specific one can be a challenge. Not on a Mac. Features like Spotlight and Quick Look make locating the file you're looking for effortless - even if you don't know the filename. And with Quick Look, you don't need to open an application to verify that you've found the right file - view a full-screen preview by hitting the space bar. Want to share a file with someone nearby? Just drag and drop to send it to the person wirelessly with AirDrop.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>See Everything Running on Your Mac Instantly</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>OS X offers system wide support for gorgeous, full-screen apps that use every inch of your Mac display. You can have multiple full-screen apps open at once - along with multiple apps in windows. And it's easy to switch between full-screen and desktop views. Mission Control gives you a bird's-eye view of all your windows and full-screen apps, and allows you to instantly navigate among them.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Auto Save</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Auto Save automatically saves your work while you work, without you having to do a thing. Versions creates a new version of a document each time you open it and every hour while you're working. It saves only the differences between successive versions, so the impact on your disk drive is minimal. Just open Versions to see the current document next to a cascade of previous versions. You can copy and paste between versions or revert to an earlier version. And when you share a document, you share only the most recent copy.</dd><br /></dl><br /><h3 class=&quot;featureHeader c27 fs24&quot;>Built-in Apps</h3><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>iPhoto</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>iPhoto is an easy-to-use photo application that makes it fast and fun to organize and find your pictures, as well as make them look their absolute best. With features like Faces, Places, and Events, iPhoto helps you keep track of your photos by who's in them and when and where you took them - all in an immersive full-screen view. Quick and simple editing tools let you make so-so shots picture perfect with just a few clicks. Photo Stream in iCloud automatically pushes new photos to all your devices, so you're never without your latest shots. And if you feel like showing off what you've captured, iPhoto lets you share with beautiful photo books and letterpress cards or online via Facebook and Flickr.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>iMovie</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>With iMovie, you can transform the videos you shoot into your very own indie flicks. If you know how to drag and drop, you can make a movie in iMovie. It comes with Apple-designed themes that look fun and professional. Just choose one and iMovie does the rest, adding animated titles and sophisticated transitions automatically. Customize your screen gem further with your own words and audio.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>GarageBand</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Whether you're musically gifted or mostly curious, GarageBand is the application for you. Plug in your electric guitar or USB music keyboard and get ready to rock with virtual replicas of the most revered amps and stompboxes in the world, as well as over 100 software instruments. Just because you didn't grow up learning your A, B, and C sharp doesn't mean you can't. Basic Lessons teach you just that: the basics. Choose from 40 lessons that cover blues guitar, rock guitar, classical piano, pop piano, and more. Or get a private lesson from one of your musical heroes, like Sting or Death Cab for Cutie, with Artist Lessons. GarageBand even tells you how well you're playing in real time with a feature called &quot;How Did I Play?&quot;</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>iBooks</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Now you can launch the iBooks app on your Mac and the books you've already downloaded on your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch will automatically appear in your library. And there are over 2 million more books in the iBooks Store, ready for you to download with just a few clicks. Reading books is intuitive and easy - turn pages with a swipe and zoom in on images with a pinch. If you're a student hitting the books, keep as many open as you like and search through them with ease. And when you take notes, highlight passages or add a bookmark on your Mac, iCloud pushes them to all your devices automatically. iCloud even remembers which page you're on. So if you start reading on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, you can pick up right where you left off on your Mac.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Maps</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>You can look up directions on your Mac and send them right to your iPhone for voice navigation on the way. In addition, your bookmarks and recent searches are automatically pushed to all your iOS devices, so you can plan trips on your Mac and have all the locations easily at hand when you're on the road. Of course, you can get information on local points of interest like restaurants and hotels, with phone numbers, photos, and even Yelp reviews. Because it's a native app, you can use every pixel of your display to explore new destinations. Maps also takes full advantage of the graphics power of your Mac. So zooming is smooth and responsive and you get gorgeous views such as Flyover, a photo-realistic, interactive 3D experience that lets you soar high above select cities.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>iCloud Keychain</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Remembering your passwords can be a real pain, but now iCloud Keychain remembers them for you. It stores your website user names and passwords on the Mac and iOS devices you've approved, protects them with robust 256-bit AES encryption and keeps them up to date on each device. And it automatically fills them in whenever you need them. It also works with credit card information, so checking out is quick yet secure.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Multiple Displays</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>OS X takes full advantage of every display connected to your Mac, giving you even more flexibility to work the way you want. There's no longer a primary or secondary display - now each has its own menu bar, and the Dock is available on whichever screen you're working on. You can run a full-screen app on one display and have multiple windows on another display, or run a fullâ€‘screen app independently on each display. You can even turn your HDTV into a fully functional second display using AirPlay and Apple TV.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Finder Tabs</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Finder Tabs help you declutter your desktop by consolidating multiple Finder windows into one. For example, you could keep a tab for All My Files, one for Homework, and one for AirDrop, all in a single Finder window. Each tab can have its own view - icon, list, column, or Cover Flow. To move a file from tab to tab, just drag and drop. And you can even expand a Finder window to full screen and move files wherever you want with ease.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Tags</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Tags are an intuitive way to organize and find your files, even documents stored in iCloud. Simply tag the files you want to organize together with a keyword, like &quot;Important.&quot; Then when you want to find those files, just click Important in the Finder sidebar or enter it in the search field. And all the files with that tag will appear together in one Finder window, even if they're stored in different locations. Tag a file once, or give it multiple tags to assign it to multiple projects. So if you're planning an event, you could tag the guest list you saved in Numbers, the flyer you designed in Pages, and the presentation you created in Keynote - and see them all with just one click.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Mac App Store</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Just like shopping the App Store on an iPad, the Mac App Store offers endless possibilities to browse and purchase apps. New apps install in one step right to Launchpad. And the Mac App Store lets you know when app updates are available, so you always have the latest version.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Safari</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Designed with the Mac in mind, Safari emphasizes browsing, not the browser. In full-screen view, the browser frame is only a pixel wide, and you can hide almost the entire interface if you choose. So there's nothing to distract you from an article, video, or photo album. Navigating web pages is easy with trackpad gestures; flip through web pages with a swipe, and double tap or pinch the trackpad to zoom in on text or images. Safari also features Reader, which lets you peruse articles sans annoying ads. Don't have time to finish what you've started? Reading List lets you save links to articles and other web pages for later, and iCloud keeps your Reading List up to date across all your devices. Since pages render fast in Safari, you won't miss a minute of the web.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Mail</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Mail makes it easy to manage all your email from a single, ad-free inbox. It features powerful search capabilities, with search suggestions and tokens built in. It works with the free me.com email account you get when you sign up for iCloud, as well as most email standards - including POP3 and IMAP - and popular email services such as Gmail, Comcast, Time Warner, Charter, Cox, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL Mail. Mail supports Microsoft Exchange 2010, too. If you have more than one email account, no problem. Add your accounts to Mail and you'll be able to access all your email from one place. And Mail looks as great as it works. It makes full use of your display with a gorgeous widescreen view featuring a full-height message and a message list that includes snippets. With Conversations, messages from the same thread appear in an elegant timeline showing each communication as it was sent while hiding redundant text.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Calendar</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Keep track of your busy schedule and share it with others using Calendar. Create separate calendars - one for home, another for school, a third for work, and so on. See all your calendars in a single window or choose to see only the calendars you want. Calendar lets you create invitations using information from Contacts, update your guest list, keep track of responses, and receive the latest status information. When you or another Mac user receives a Calendar invitation via Mail, it's automatically added. Calendar also works with iCloud, Yahoo!, and Google. And when you use iCloud, every Calendar edit you make on your Mac automatically appears on your iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch. So no dinner dates are missed, no meeting goes unattended, and no anniversary is forgotten.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Contacts</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Contacts is a flexible and convenient place to store information for everyone you know. It's easy to import names, numbers, addresses, and photos from other applications. And it's designed for Facebook, too. Contacts automatically includes your friends' profile photos and information. And when friends update their information, Contacts updates your Mac. You can create smart groups for clubs, activities, and business purposes; print address labels and envelopes; and more. iCloud updates your contacts on your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and Mac - so when you enter someone's contact info once, you have it everywhere. And since Contacts is built on vCard, an industry standard for storing contact information, your friends can send you cards that you can add simply by dropping them into your contacts list - no typing required.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Time Machine</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Time Machine works with your Mac and an external hard drive (sold separately) or Time Capsule. Connect the drive, assign it to Time Machine, and start enjoying some peace of mind. Time Machine automatically backs up your entire Mac, including system files, applications, accounts, preferences, music, photos, movies, and documents. But what makes Time Machine different from other backup applications is that it not only keeps a spare copy of every file, it remembers how your system looked on any given day - so you can revisit your Mac as it appeared in the past.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>FaceTime</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>FaceTime for Mac makes it possible to talk, smile, and laugh with anyone on an iPad, iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPod touch, or another Mac from your Mac. And when someone tries to reach you, the call rings through on every Mac you own, even if FaceTime isn't running. So you never have to worry about making yourself available. If you don't want to receive calls, just turn FaceTime off in preferences. FaceTime is integrated with your Address Book so you can initiate chats easily.</dd><br /></dl><br /><dl><br /><dt class=&quot;c28 fs18 bold&quot;>Photo Booth</dt><br /><dd class=&quot;c28&quot;>Take photo snapshots and video clips with your Mac using Photo Booth. Send them to your friends, use one as an iChat icon, add them to your Address Book, or organize and edit them in iPhoto. The real fun starts when you use the effects and backdrops in Photo Booth. Choose from nine effects that use facial tracking technology so effects look great whether you're front and center - or left of center. Snap single photos or shoot multiples in a four-photo burst. You can even shoot video clips, complete with effects, then trim them right in Photo Booth and send them to friends and family. And since Photo Booth can be viewed full screen, you'll enjoy every detail down to the last pixel.</dd><br /></dl><br /></div><br /><div class=&quot;top-left js-topLeft left&quot;>&nbsp;</div><br /><div class=&quot;top-center&quot; data-selenium=&quot;topCenter&quot;>&nbsp;</div>",
