Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet.

This desktop computer is outfitted with the 5th generation Broadwell 3.3 GHz Intel Core i7-i7-5820K processor that comes with 15MB of L3 cache memory and six cores, which allows for greater multi-tasking capabilities. It comes equipped with 8GB of DDR4 memory to help you run multiple applications and can also support up to 32GB when applications require more. Windows 8.1 is pre-installed on the 2TB 7200 rpm hard drive that still offers enough space to store all your important files, photos, videos, and more.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Experience lag-free gameplay and smooth 1080p video playback with the NVIDIA Geforce GTX 980 graphics card with 4GB of video memory. This graphics card supports multiple monitors and offers HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI ports for immersing you when gaming or working. For connectivity, this desktop provides Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0, four USB 2.0, and six USB 3.0 ports as well as a plethora of audio ports that are powered by Creative Sound Core 3D audio technology. Furthermore, you can save and transfer data using the memory card reader or the slot-loading DVD burner.</p><p><strong>Triad Chassis</strong></p><p><strong>Pivot and Light</strong>&nbsp;<br /> The Area-51's three corners are built to support 5 times the system's weight. Pivot the system towards you and gain easy access to the rear ports when connecting or disconnecting cables. There is even a button on the back of the chassis that turns on the rear accessibility lighting to help you see.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>Carry On</strong>&nbsp;<br /> The rugged handles make the Area-51 more natural to carry. The shape and internal component layout are designed to have a low center of gravity to avoid the system from tipping when being lifted.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>Easy Access</strong>&nbsp;<br /> The angular shape is designed to have all the I/O ports facing you directly, making connecting a USB device, headphones, or even a media card reader easier than on a traditional rectangular chassis design.</p><p><strong>Designed to Keep Cool</strong></p><p>Internal fans blow fresh ambient air, quietly, and directly onto the graphics card. The internal cable management system enables maximum airflow - satisfying your system's hunger for cooler air and keeping it performing at its peak. The angled design also provides a large space for hot air to escape where a traditional rectangular chassis only leaves a small space between it and the wall.</p><p><strong>Processing Power</strong></p><p>The Alienware Area-51 ushers in performance with Windows 8.1 and a 6-core Intel Core i7 processor. The Intel X99 Express chipset supports 2133 MHz DDR4 memory - up to 32GB in quad channel. In addition, the processor is liquid cooled, allowing it to be easily overclocked.</p><p><strong>Big Storage</strong></p><p>The storage bays support up to five drives of either SSD or HDD. Enjoy the pure speed of solid state and the big storage of hard drives - allowing for quick boot and massive archiving capabilities.</p><p><strong>Connect with Confidence</strong></p><p>The Ethernet assembly has been built by Killer Technology. It prioritizes streaming video and gaming packets for the smoothest possible performance when you need it most. Plus, it comes fully equipped with 802.11ac - the latest wireless protocol.</p><p><strong>Alienware Command Center 4.0</strong></p><p><strong>AlienFX</strong>&nbsp;<br /> Customize your lighting experience with AlienFX that provides nine independent programmable lighting zones. You can create up to 512 trillion color combos with over 20 colors to choose from.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Alien Adrenaline&nbsp;</strong><br /> The Alien Adrenaline performance monitoring app lets you view detailed graphs that tell you real-time details about the CPU, memory, graphics card, and network adapter.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Overclocking Controls</strong>&nbsp;<br /> Manually tinker with the settings of your CPU to raise performance even beyond the stock settings.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Manual DRAM Adjustments</strong>&nbsp;<br /> Optimize the memory for maximum performance and ensure that your system runs at peak power while gaming.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Overclocking Profile</strong>&nbsp;<br /> Enhance your gaming features and squeeze as much power as possible by adjusting the system's settings.&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Thermal Controls</strong>&nbsp;<br /> Alienware's Thermal Controls allow you to control the thermal and venting behavior of your Area-51. You can also create and save multiple thermal and venting profiles for different usage scenarios.</p>",

Visuals are handled by a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5 discrete memory.</p><p>The system is powered by a quad-core 4th generation Crystalwell 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 processor. The 4th-gen Crystalwell processor uses low voltage for improved battery life without sacrificing performance. The MacBook Pro with Retina Display also has 16GB of onboard 1600MHz DDR3L RAM, 512GB of PCIe-based flash storage and an SDXC media card slot.

         "productDescription":"<p> The Synology DiskStation DS412+ 4-Bay All-In-1 NAS Server For SMB Users is specially engineered for small- to medium-sized businesses requiring a high-performance, easily-managed and full-featured NAS (Network Attached Storage) solution. The DiskStation centralizes data backups, safeguards vital assets and shares files across various platforms.</p><p ><br />The DS412+ enables fast transfer speeds of approximately 205MB/s read and 183MB/s write when using a RAID 5 configuration in a Windows-based environment, with link aggregation enabled. It's equipped with 2 LAN with failover and link aggregation support, which, combined with a convenient hot-swappable hard drive design, ensures continual service uptime in the event that the drives require replacement or LAN fails unexpectedly. The DiskStation features blazing-fast USB 3.0 connectivity, offering transmission speeds of up to 5Gbps.<br  />CPU Passive Cooling Technology and System Fan Redundancy work to prevent overheating, in order to keep the DS412+ running optimally. This also allows the system to avoid reliance on a dedicated processor cooling fan and mitigate critical points of failure. When the system detects fan failures, the integrated redundancy mechanism spins up the functional fan, giving proper ventilation to the system, while supporting continued operations until your replacement fan is in position. Thus, system damage is minimized, while availability is maximized.<br  />Synology's Hybrid RAID (SHR) automatically constructs an optimal RAID volume with data protection based on the hard drives installed, so you need not have hard drives of identical size. The SHR still provides a manual setup option for advanced users. Multiple Volumes on RAID enables you to generate numerous volumes on a RAID structure, giving you a versatile and efficient way to manage your storage across all available drives. Should the need arise to expand your volumes, just allocate additional storage space on the UI and DSM will take care of the rest for you--without any service disruption.<br  />The system runs on Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), delivering comprehensive applications and features targeted at office and business workgroups. Web Station with PHP / MySQL support permits one Synology DS412+ to host as many as 30 websites, as well as multiple 3rd party web applications, including Content Management, Customer Relationship Management and e-Commerce systems.<br  />The integrated mail server transforms Synology DS412+ into a dedicated mail service provider, while the add-on package, Mail Station 2, offers a webmail interface for users to access emails stored on Synology DS412+. </p>",
