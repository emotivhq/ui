         "productDescription":"<div>The Philips Hue Personal Wireless Lighting Kit includes 3 bulbs and a bridge that connects to your home Wi-Fi and up to 50 Philips Hue Bulbs/Lighting.&nbsp; It is probably the most exciting and unique product anyone will have purchased.&nbsp; You can have the lights sync with an alarm to wake up to lighting, set it on schedules to automatically turn on at certain times, and IFTTT connectivity to other 3rd party apps is mindblowing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br /><div>Caution: There will be a stong urge to acquire additional bulbs and lighting options (such as the LED lighting strips) which can be pricey- but it is totally worth it!</div><br /><div>The wireless LED light bulbs bring hue to life. They deliver clear and crisp light. All shades of white. And every color in the spectrum. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t just look great. They&rsquo;re practical too. They dim. They flash. They pulse. They do pretty much anything you want. And they screw straight into your current light fittings. Naturally. &nbsp;Hue light bulbs are available in E26, E27, GU10, PAR16 and BR30 formats. Or for something a bit different, try LivingColors Bloom, Iris and LightStrips.</div><br /><div>The Bridge. The heart of the hue system. The bridge is literally a bridge between your app and the bulbs. Linked to wi-fi via your router, it can connect up to 50 bulbs at a time. Not to mention hue&rsquo;s other accessories, like hue tap. &nbsp;The bridge also connects your system to the wider world. With it you can control your lights remotely or link them up to the rest of the web, newsfeeds or even your own inbox. It&rsquo;s really rather smart.</div><br /><div>The App. &nbsp;The App is Key. The key to controlling hue lies in the palm of your hand. Use the app to change colors, brightness, functions and everything else in between. However you want it.<br />Control your bulbs one at a time or all together. Find the right intensity and shade of white for the task at hand. Pick that perfect tone to match the moment. Or select a color from a photo and recreate it in your room.</div><br /><div>&nbsp;</div>",

This desktop computer is outfitted with the 5th generation Broadwell 3.3 GHz Intel Core i7-i7-5820K processor that comes with 15MB of L3 cache memory and six cores, which allows for greater multi-tasking capabilities. It comes equipped with 8GB of DDR4 memory to help you run multiple applications and can also support up to 32GB when applications require more. Windows 8.1 is pre-installed on the 2TB 7200 rpm hard drive that still offers enough space to store all your important files, photos, videos, and more.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Experience lag-free gameplay and smooth 1080p video playback with the NVIDIA Geforce GTX 980 graphics card with 4GB of video memory. This graphics card supports multiple monitors and offers HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI ports for immersing you when gaming or working.

The shape and internal component layout are designed to have a low center of gravity to avoid the system from tipping when being lifted.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>Easy Access</strong>&nbsp;<br /> The angular shape is designed to have all the I/O ports facing you directly, making connecting a USB device, headphones, or even a media card reader easier than on a traditional rectangular chassis design.</p><p><strong>Designed to Keep Cool</strong></p><p>Internal fans blow fresh ambient air, quietly, and directly onto the graphics card. The internal cable management system enables maximum airflow - satisfying your system's hunger for cooler air and keeping it performing at its peak.

The Intel X99 Express chipset supports 2133 MHz DDR4 memory - up to 32GB in quad channel.

         "productDescription":"<p> The Synology DiskStation DS412+ 4-Bay All-In-1 NAS Server For SMB Users is specially engineered for small- to medium-sized businesses requiring a high-performance, easily-managed and full-featured NAS (Network Attached Storage) solution. The DiskStation centralizes data backups, safeguards vital assets and shares files across various platforms.</p><p ><br />The DS412+ enables fast transfer speeds of approximately 205MB/s read and 183MB/s write when using a RAID 5 configuration in a Windows-based environment, with link aggregation enabled. It's equipped with 2 LAN with failover and link aggregation support, which, combined with a convenient hot-swappable hard drive design, ensures continual service uptime in the event that the drives require replacement or LAN fails unexpectedly. The DiskStation features blazing-fast USB 3.0 connectivity, offering transmission speeds of up to 5Gbps.<br  />CPU Passive Cooling Technology and System Fan Redundancy work to prevent overheating, in order to keep the DS412+ running optimally. This also allows the system to avoid reliance on a dedicated processor cooling fan and mitigate critical points of failure. When the system detects fan failures, the integrated redundancy mechanism spins up the functional fan, giving proper ventilation to the system, while supporting continued operations until your replacement fan is in position. Thus, system damage is minimized, while availability is maximized.<br  />Synology's Hybrid RAID (SHR) automatically constructs an optimal RAID volume with data protection based on the hard drives installed, so you need not have hard drives of identical size. The SHR still provides a manual setup option for advanced users. Multiple Volumes on RAID enables you to generate numerous volumes on a RAID structure, giving you a versatile and efficient way to manage your storage across all available drives. Should the need arise to expand your volumes, just allocate additional storage space on the UI and DSM will take care of the rest for you--without any service disruption.<br  />The system runs on Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), delivering comprehensive applications and features targeted at office and business workgroups. Web Station with PHP / MySQL support permits one Synology DS412+ to host as many as 30 websites, as well as multiple 3rd party web applications, including Content Management, Customer Relationship Management and e-Commerce systems.<br  />The integrated mail server transforms Synology DS412+ into a dedicated mail service provider, while the add-on package, Mail Station 2, offers a webmail interface for users to access emails stored on Synology DS412+. </p>",
