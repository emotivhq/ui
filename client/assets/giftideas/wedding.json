         "productDescription":"The INSTEON Connected Home Automation Kit is a prepackaged bundle that includes an INSTEON Hub, two Dimmer Modules, a Wired Thermostat, Indoor Wireless IP Camera, Motion, Leak and Open/Close Sensors. This kit works together, allowing you to wirelessly control the lighting and temperature in your home, even from remote locations. The included INSTEON Hub features Ethernet connectivity for interfacing with your home network. Once connected, you can download the free INSTEON control app for setting up and controlling your connected devices from a smartphone, tablet or computer. The app can be found in the Google Play, Apple, Amazon and Windows app stores. Mac OS X and Linux users can enjoy browser-based system control. In addition to the included items, the INSTEON Hub supports a variety of INSTEON home automation devices. <br><br>Each included Dimmer Module has a 2-prong interface for connecting a lamp for remote lighting control. Using the INSTEON user interface, you can control light output by selecting a specific percentage. For direct access, brightness and dimming buttons are also located directly on the modules. In addition to basic on and off control, you can even set lighting schedules and scenes. An Indoor Wireless IP camera is also included, which allows you to remotely monitor your home or connected environment. The camera also supports pan and tilt functionality and has a built-in microphone and speaker for communication. <br><br>Rounding out this bundle are sensors for detecting motion, leaks, the opening and closing of windows and doors, as well as a Wired Thermostat. The INSTEON Wired Thermostat works with the INSTEON control app for adjusting the thermostat. Using the app you can control the thermostat when you're away from your home. As an added convenience, you can set up a 7-day schedule, which means you don't have to interact with your system every day. The Motion Sensor can communicate with up to 400 INSTEON devices and has a built-in countdown timer than can automatically turn lights off when you leave a room. The Leak Sensor can easily integrate into your INSTEON system and send alerts to your smartphone or tablet when a leak is detected. The Open/Close Sensor includes a magnet for mounting, and can be programmed to power-on connected devices like lamps and appliances when you enter or exit a room. Additionally, once the Connected Kit is installed and configured, there are no monthly service fees or contract agreements required for operation.  <br><br>PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS<br>-Wireless Home & Remote Automation<br>-Includes INSTEON Hub<br>-Smartphone and Tablet Interface<br>-Create Schedules and Scenes<br>-Includes Two Dimmer Modules<br>-Includes Indoor Wireless IP Camera<br>-Includes Thermostat<br>-Includes Motion & Leak Sensors<br>-Includes Open/Close Sensor",
