         "productDescription":"GiftStarter went out and interviewed teachers and found out this is the gift many of them requested for their classrooms!  The Hitachi CP-X3030WN XGA Multi-Region LCD Projector features an XGA 1024 x 768 native resolution and Polysilicon TFT 3LCD projection chip technology, which delivers authentic color reproduction in most lighting conditions. The CP-X3030WN provides 3200 ANSI lumens of white output and color output brightness, as well as a high 4000:1 contrast ratio. This results in vivid and well defined presentations - even in excessive ambient light. The 6.6 lb projector is also quite portable, so you can easily move it from classroom to classroom or conference room to conference room. The CP-X3030WN is equipped with 30&deg; of digital vertical keystone correction, manual focus and 1.2x manual zoom. It's compatible with HDTV, NTSC, PAL and SEACAM systems. The CP-X3030WN also has an HDMI input, dual VGA inputs and a variety of other analog video input options. There are several audio inputs as well, including a microphone input. Plus, you can play back audio using the built-in 16W mono speaker, which also supports audio pass-through using a more efficient low power mode. However, there is an audio output as well in case you want to send your presentation's audio through larger speakers or even a PA system. There are also multiple USB inputs that support USB display, PC-less presenting, wireless network connection (Wi-Fi adapter required) and USB mouse control. The CP-X3030WN Ethernet jack supports network connectivity. This allows you to integrate the projector with Crestron RoomView, PJ-Link and AMX Device Discovery for remote operation and audits of network projectors. This model also features multiple picture modes and a teaching template function with four line patterns to choose from. There are several security measures as well. Other features include a variety of customizable control options, support for multiple OSD languages, several picture adjustment functions and a low overall cost of ownership thanks to the Eco Mode, the long-lamp life, the Hybrid Filter and the outward, top-entry lamp door for maintenance ease. This is one of the best and most useful gifts for a teacher (presenter, or many other people who often present in front of others)",

Offering local and web communication ability, a software packed with useful and effective presentation tools, and almost instant integration with projectors and displays, the MO-1 is a productive presentation companion for educators and business professionals. The core of the MO-1 is the 300&deg; movable camera head. It serves as a video camera, a webcam, and a photo camera/scanner. It has a zoomable lens that lets you focus in on parts of a scene or magnify details of a document (from as close as 2.7 inches away).  In addition, a built-in microphone lets you use the webcam function to conduct online meetings. Connected to a computer, any images captured with the photo camera/scanner function can be saved to an SD card. Connected to a projector or HDTV, you can apply a bunch of enhancements to the images. These enhancements are applicable from the software that comes included. Some of them are split-screen, highlight, mask, picture-in-picture, color filters, and annotations. The MO-1 can also optionally connect to an Elmo CRA-1 wireless tablet with which you can deliver your presentations wirelessly from as far as 50 feet away as you walk around the room. The software's enhancement features are also applicable from the tablet. The MO-1 comes with an AC adapter but can alternatively get its power by simple USB connection to a computer. This is really the perfect gift for someone who presents and teaches often in front of others.",

An added bonus for tighter spaces is that it sits tall and deep instead of spreading out, thanks to its unique, two-disc pattern. The super-soft filling is made of premium, shredded Durafoam. Unlike bead-filled bags, it absorbs your body weight evenly and doesn't compress over time, but stays airy and supple like a sit-able cloud.v What's Included: Citysac Khakisac,Caribbean Micro Velvet Citysac Cover,Premium Citysac Duffel Bag. About Caribbean Micro Velvet Covers. With a velvety hand, and deep suede-like nap, Micro Velvet is more resilient and stain-proof than traditional velvet, and thicker and loftier than Microsuede.

With rub counts that are many times higher than even the durable Microsuede, Micro Velvet is a great choice if you are looking for a tough yet very soft fabric.
