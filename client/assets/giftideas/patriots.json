         "productDescription":"Cecile Grongnet does almost everything herself. Her precision and the long heritage of generations that came before her is obvious in this cuvée. It has a hugely expressive nose with notes of baked bread, roasted almonds, and aromas linked to aging in a cellar. It is fresh and harmonious with beautiful acid and nice bitters combining for a tart finish.<br>REGION: Côte Des Blancs<br>VILLAGE: Etoges<br>RODUCER: Cecile Grongnet is the fifth generation of the Grongnet family to run this operation and she does almost everything by herself. The Champagne house has been in the same location since 1885 when her great great grandfather started the business. They are located in the village of Etoges, which is in the middle of the Côte des Blancs region of Champagne. They are one of only 26 Champagne houses to be part of the “Special Club”, which is an exclusive club comprised of only the top Champagne houses elected by their peers. The cuvées that she produces all have a very low dosage and most undergo no malolatic fermentation. This means that the grapes she uses are of the best quality; patriots the end result would be austere and unbalanced.<br>FOOD PAIRING IDEAS: It can be served as an aperitif of course, but also with shellfish and especially clams. Pasta or pizza with sauces that aren’t too spicy or sweet will also work well with this dry and crisp cuvée.",
