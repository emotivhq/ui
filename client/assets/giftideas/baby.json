Like the crumple zones that protect us in the cars we drive, the crumple zone system integrated into every Foonf child seat absorbs energy from a collision preventing it from being transmitted to the child, reducing the forces on a forward-facing child in frontal collision by up to 40%.</p><br /><p>Foonf is also engineered with both advanced rear-facing and side-impact safety systems. In rear-facing mode, Foonf boasts a 50 lbs weight limit to keep children rear-facing longer and is designed with an anti-rebound bar, which improves stability and further protects the child's head. Rear-facing installation features a simple, click-in angle-adjustment wedge with quick-access to standard LATCH connectors. The seat is also built on a rigid metal sub-structure with energy-absorbing foam layers in the sides and headrest to protect the child in a side-impact collision.<br /><br />Committed to designing convenience into car seats, Foonf is designed with Clek's signature rigid LATCH system, making proper forward-facing installation effortless. Its narrow width profile of under 17 inches at its widest point (and 13 inches at the base) provides space that makes 3-across seating possible.</p><br /><p>After its 9-year expiration, Foonf lives on. The seat is recyclable through Clek's recycling program and is also Made in Canada.</p><br /><p>Features:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>REACT safety system and foam layers protect child in side-impact collisions</li><br /><li>3-across seating possible with narrow width of 17 inches</li><br /><li>Reinforced by a steel and magnesium sub-structure</li><br /><li>LATCH equipped</li><br /><li>Recyclable</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Manufacturer Recommended Weight/Height/Age Limits:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Rear-facing: From 14 to 50 lbs, from 25 to 43 inches, from 6 months and up</li><br /><li>Forward-facing: From 20 to 65 lbs, from 30 to 49 inches</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Product Dimensions:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Depth/Height/Width: 33 x 26 x 17 inches</li><br /><li>Weight: 36 lbs (forward-facing)</li><br /></ul>",
