In fact, the word “baby” isn’t even in the title, because this seat will hold a kid (or parent!) up to 130 POUNDS! Typical bouncers will top out between 15-20 pounds which for some kids means the seat is only usable for the first few months before it gets packed away in storage. The nuna LEAF will sway at the slightest touch, gently rocking the baby to sleep. For feeding time or use by older kids, the seat position can be locked. Bonus: no batteries, cords, buzz or noise! Accessories available for the seat and sold separately include a toy bar and the nuna wind, a motorized box that will make the seat sway continually (much like an infant swing).",
