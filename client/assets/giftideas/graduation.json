It is able to capture Full HD 1080p at up to 60 fps and - for even more detailed shots - capture 2.7K (2704 x 1520) at 30 fps and 4K (3840 x 2160) at 15 fps. There are a number of other frame rates and resolutions as well, including a 100 fps mode ideal for creating slow motion effects that is available in 960p and 720p. But the HERO Silver's capabilities don't stop with video. It can also take 12-megapixel stills, as individual shots, in intervals for stitching together time-lapse movies, or in momentary bursts of up to 30 photos per second - the latter helping ensure you catch fast action at just the right moment.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>For remote monitoring and operation, the camera is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, letting you pair it with a mobile device or the separately available Smart Remote. There is also a USB port for file transfer, charging, or to connect the optional 3.5mm mic adapter. In addition to the bundled flat and curved adhesive mounts, the camera is also adaptable to a wide range of separately available mounts from GoPro and third-parties - with options to accommodate just about any scenario imaginable.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p style=&quot;margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;>Group gift it to capture and share those memories together. &nbsp;</p>",
