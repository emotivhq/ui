Origami was created by Buddhist Monks in Japan 1500 years ago—and now has applications in cutting-edge engineering, from heart valves to telescopes. Oru is the Japanese word meaning ‘to fold,’ and we’re as inspired by traditional arts as we are by new technologies.<br><br>On the water, the Bay is 12 feet of pure grace and speed.
