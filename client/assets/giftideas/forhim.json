The sturdy frame sheet protects the duffel from baggage-handler abuse and keeps your Black Hole upright, even when it&rsquo;s loaded to the max. Oversized wheels deliver a smooth ride, whether you&rsquo;re crossing the tarmac or following a cobblestone street. Carrying options include the main webbing handles (with snap closure), a telescoping handle or the two haul loops on either end. You can lash additional gear to the outside with the four corner-mounted daisy chains.

There an increasing, quality competition in the world of whiskey. Mellow and rich, no liquor is quite as luxurious and masculine as single malt scotch. Aged in &quot;the finest&quot; Oloroso sherry butts, the Glendronach 18 year is the darkest and most dense of the three standard expressions. Loaded with spice cake and dark toffee on the nose, the palate follows through with all of the flavor without ever going over the top. It's fudgy and loaded with dried fruit on the backend, showcasing everything you're looking for something like Macallan 18, albeit for $90 less per bottle.  Need we say more?",

This is perfect for a single dad, or for the recent college grad who needs a little help figuring out that whole “cooking without starting a grease fire” thing.  Using a Crock-Pot is practically idiot-proof.  Just throw all your ingredients before you go to work, and you come home to a hot meal.  This has a cool tech aspect as well for the gadget geeks. You can adjust cooking time, temperature, shift to warm, or turn off entirely using the smartphone app.  Drop in the ingredients in the morning, and use a smartphone to turn it on so a warm meal is ready when you walk in the door.  Perfect!",
