It features 800-fill-power 100% Traceable Down (European goose down that can be traced back to birds that were never force-fed, never live-plucked) and an ultralight nylon ripstop shell fabric that&rsquo;s nearly half the weight and twice the strength of other down shell fabrics. The sewn-through construction, tight channel pattern and just the right amount of down increase versatility for use in more moderate temperatures and diverse activities, while a DWR (durable water repellent) finish sheds snow. A slim silhouette maximizes thermal efficiency and suits its ideal uses: belay jacket over light layers at shaded crags, minimalist summer alpine bivies and unmatched warmth layered under a shell. Pockets include two zippered handwarmers and one zippered chest. A drawcord hem keeps in the heat. Stuffsack included.</span></p>",

Highly weather-resistant, it will protect your gear from rough handling and hold everything you need for an extended trip. Its main compartment is accessed by a zippered U-shaped lid, which has a pair of zippered mesh pockets on the underside to hold small items. A zippered exterior pocket provides a secure, easy-access place for your boarding pass, energy bar or paperback. The sturdy frame sheet protects the duffel from baggage-handler abuse and keeps your Black Hole upright, even when it&rsquo;s loaded to the max. Oversized wheels deliver a smooth ride, whether you&rsquo;re crossing the tarmac or following a cobblestone street. Carrying options include the main webbing handles (with snap closure), a telescoping handle or the two haul loops on either end. You can lash additional gear to the outside with the four corner-mounted daisy chains. Made from 14.7-oz 1,200-denier polyester (50% solution-dyed) with a TPU-film laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish.</span></p>",
