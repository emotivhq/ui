Highly weather-resistant, it will protect your gear from rough handling and hold everything you need for an extended trip. Its main compartment is accessed by a zippered U-shaped lid, which has a pair of zippered mesh pockets on the underside to hold small items. A zippered exterior pocket provides a secure, easy-access place for your boarding pass, energy bar or paperback. The sturdy frame sheet protects the duffel from baggage-handler abuse and keeps your Black Hole upright, even when it&rsquo;s loaded to the max. Oversized wheels deliver a smooth ride, whether you&rsquo;re crossing the tarmac or following a cobblestone street. Carrying options include the main webbing handles (with snap closure), a telescoping handle or the two haul loops on either end. You can lash additional gear to the outside with the four corner-mounted daisy chains. Made from 14.7-oz 1,200-denier polyester (50% solution-dyed) with a TPU-film laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish.",
