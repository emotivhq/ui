<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We never post anything to your accounts with Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party sites without your permission.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Service. GiftStarter uses cookies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor, to improve the quality of our Service, and to try and make your browsing experience meaningful. When you enter our Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Service, then we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the code and cookies used by our Service are served by us, and some are served by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different browsers. By blocking or deleting cookies used on our Service, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Service.</p>
<h2>Voluntary Disclosure</h2>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas of the Site becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information through these public venues.</p>
<p>GiftStarter Gift Champions never receive users' credit card information.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>GiftStarter reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or in the good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with the law.</p>
<p>On request, we will give you a copy of all the personal information about you that we hold. This information is subject to a fee not exceeding the prescribed fee permitted by law.</p>
<p>People under 18 (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) are not permitted to use GiftStarter on their own, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for their use of the site.</p>
<p>Information that you submit through the Service may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to provide the Service to you. For example, our servers are in the United States. If we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us, but due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. Under certain circumstances, the government or third parties may lawfully or unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we may disclose information about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>GiftStarter encourages you to learn as much as you can about your privacy on the Internet. To find out more, visit <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org">www.bbbonline.org</a> or <a href="http://www.TRUSTe.com">www.TRUSTe.com</a>.</p>
