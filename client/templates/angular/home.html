            <p>Ever been a part of a "group gift"?  Ever been the person in charge of collecting all the money for that gift?  It's not fun having to ask that one friend, who never seems to have cash on him, or thinks "I'll get you back when we go out for drinks" is a valid form of payment.</p>
            <p>And what if you're the "out of town" friend, or the "my boss always makes me work weekends" friend who always contributes to group gifts, but is rarely present</p>

            <p>for the actual giving of the gift?  It's a bummer to wonder if the recipient even knew you were in on it.  GiftStarter puts the fun and convenience back into the gifting experience.  With our simple GiftStart builder, it's easy for friends and family to come together and purchase items from the web.  Once GiftStarts complete, we send the gift along with a beautiful, hand-crafted card including every one's well wishes.  The GiftStarter process is just 5 simple steps: </p>
