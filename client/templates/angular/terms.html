The amount Gift Givers contribution is the amount they will be charged.</li>

<li>Gift Givers may not cancel or reduce their contribution once the GiftStart has been funded and/or the GiftStart deadline has been passed (10 days).</li>

<li>GiftStarter does not offer refunds.</li>

<li>GiftStarter reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a GiftStart at any time and for any reason. GiftStarter is not liable for any damages as a result of any of those actions. GiftStarter’s policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</li>
