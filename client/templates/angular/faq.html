    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h2>What is GiftStarter?</h2>
    <p>GiftStarter is a Gifting Experience Service.  Our mission is to focus on the gifting experience, using technology as an enabler.  We enable the experience that captures giving between the recipient and those that give.</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Simply copy and paste a link from one of our certified retailers, fill out the campaign information to share your story on why this is important to you or your gift recipient, and bring others along on the giving journey.  We let your family and friends choose their pieces of the gift to give, we send an awesome group card to remember the experience, and the gift too.</p>
    <h2>Who can use the GiftStarter service?</h2>
    <p>Anyone can use the GiftStarter service (who has a credit card).  We are currently available in the continental United States.</p>
    <h2>What methods of payment do you support?</h2>
    <p>Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club.</p>
    <h2>How does GiftStarter compare to other crowdfunding sites?</h2>
    <p>Other crowdfunding sites focus on enabling payment process.  We focus on enabling the gifting experience all the way to delivering a group card and gift.</p>
    <h2>Where do I go if I need help?</h2>
    <p>We are always here to help!  Email us at team@giftstarter.co.  We are also on standby on Twitter (@GiftChampion) and Facebook (www.facebook.com/giftstart).</p>
    <h1>Campaigns</h1>
    <h2>How long will my campaign be live?</h2>
    <p>From the time the campaign is created, it'll be live for 10 days.</p>
    <h2>What happens if my campaign isn't completed before the due date?</h2>
    <p>Then we will send the recipient a group card with the image of what was intended, plus a gift card.</p>
    <h2>How do I create a successful campaign?</h2>
    <p>When you create the campaign title and description, share with others who will pitch in why it's awesome, why it is the perfect gift for your recipient, and any personal notes about the recipient.  Encourage others who pitch in to share their personal stories related to the recipient too!  After all, we're creating a gifting memory together!</p>
    <h1>Gifts</h1>
    <h2>After the campaign ends, when will the gift arrive?</h2>
    <p>We will send both the group card (with all those that pitched in and their personal notes) and the gift within 3-5 business days of the campaign completion.</p>
    <h2>How do I know who pitched in on the gift?</h2>
    <p>If you created the gifting campaign and/or you are the recipient, you will receive both a digital card (which you can forward on to the others) and a card in the mail.</p>
    <h1>Service Fees</h1>
    <h2>Does GiftStarter have a fee?</h2>
    <p>Yes, our GiftStarter service fee is 8%.</p>
    <h2>Who pays the fees?</h2>
    <p>The service fee is split up into the pieces, meaning everyone is only paying a little bit more.</p>
    <h2>Is there a sales tax?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we have to pay all required legal taxes.</p>
    <h2>Do I get a receipt?</h2>
    <p>Yes, as soon as you pitch in, you will receive an email receipt.</p>
    <h1>Security</h1>
    <h2>Is my credit card information secure?</h2>
    <p>Security is our top priority. To get specific, our site uses industry standard 128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure that sensitive data (ie. credit card number, name, address, etc.) is transmitted securely during every transaction. SSL encrypts the data before it is transmitted so that it can never be read. You will see the SSL seal displayed on the page during checkout and the address bar will change to begin with https.</p>
    <h2>Is my personal information safe?</h2>
    <p>We’re sticklers about this. We never share or sell any of the personal information of our registrants or gift-givers.</p>
