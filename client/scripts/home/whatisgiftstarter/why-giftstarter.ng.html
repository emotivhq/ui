                    <strong>We remove the barrier of large price tags.</strong>
                    The gifts most people want are more expensive than the average giver is
                    able to gift alone, but with GiftStarter, <strong>many people can give
                    a little and together give gifts people actually want.</strong> Imagine
                    a world where birthdays aren't just an assortment of gift cards and
                    $20 checks from grandma.

                    We didn't invent group gifting, but we did make sure the recipient will
                    know exactly who was involved in the gift. Each participant can <strong>
                    add a picture and personal message to the handcrafted group card. </strong>
                    Once the gift is received, the recipient can <strong>post a thank you note
                    </strong> and picture on the gift campaign page for all the contributors
                    to see.
