    <p><span class="title">IF YOU CAN BUY IT ONLINE, YOU CAN GIFT IT WITH GIFTSTARTER.</span> When you set up your gift
    campaign, you can <strong>choose how many tiles</strong> will be in your grid. We <strong>break up the price of
        the product into tiles</strong>, so the more tiles you have, the cheaper each tile is! Once your gift
    campaign is set up, you <strong>invite your friends to buy tiles</strong> -- and your part is finished! Each
    contributor can <strong>purchase as many or as few tiles as they wish</strong>, then leave a message for the group
    card when they check out. <strong>We take care of everything else</strong> -- from ensuring the gift is
    ordered and shipped to making and sending the homemade group card, we've got you covered!</p>
