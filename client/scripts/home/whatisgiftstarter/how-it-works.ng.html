    <p><span class="title">IF YOU CAN BUY IT ONLINE, YOU CAN GIFT IT WITH GIFTSTARTER.</span> <span id="howitworks-paragraph">When you set up your gift
    campaign, you can <strong>choose how many pieces</strong> will be in your grid. We <strong>break up the price of
    the product into pieces</strong>, so the more pieces you have, the cheaper each piece is! Once your gift
    campaign is set up, you <strong>invite your friends to buy pieces</strong> -- and your part is finished! Each
    contributor can <strong>purchase as many or as few pieces as they wish</strong>, then leave a message for the group
    card when they check out. <strong>We take care of everything else</strong> -- from ensuring the gift is
    ordered and shipped to making and sending the homemade group card, we've got you covered!</span></p>
