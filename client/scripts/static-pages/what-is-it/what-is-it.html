        <p>Giving an awesome gift is hard - what your friends really want is usually too expensive.  With GiftStarter, you can bring your friends and family together to get a bigger, better gift.</p>
        <p>All you have to do is create a campaign on GiftStarter and invite your friends!  It's easy for everyone to pitch in, and leave their own special message.  Once it's all bought, GiftStart ships the recipient a beautiful hand-crafted card with everyone's well-wishes, and ships them the gift too!</p>
