At that point, you could say it's almost free.</p>

To get specific, our site uses industry standard 128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure that sensitive data (ie. credit card number, name, address, etc.) is transmitted securely during every transaction. SSL encrypts the data before it is transmitted so that it can never be read. You will see the SSL seal displayed on the page during checkout and the address bar will change to begin with https.</p>
